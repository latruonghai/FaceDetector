# FaceDetector
In this project i have first try to detect a face (a base project of computer vision).
There are two folders in this project:
  * FaceDetect: To detect human's face (if it's available) in every image.
  * Augmentation: To enlarge the number of face in dataset (for DeepLearning which algorithm needing a large number of dataset)
  * Regconite: That you can Recognite a face base on the models which have been trained.
